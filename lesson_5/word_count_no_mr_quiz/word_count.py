def word_count():
    # We are going to count the occurences of all the words that appear in the book
    # Alice in Wonderland.
    # 
    # Thus, for this exercise, you need to write a program that will tally
    # the occurences of all the words that appears in Alice in Wonderland serially.
    #
    # The text in Alice in Wonderland will be fed into this program line by line.
    # And you need to write a program that will take each line and do the following:
    # 1) Tokenize a line of text into string tokens, by white space
    #    Example: "Hello, World!" will be converted into "Hello," and "World!"
    #
    # 2) Remove all punctuations
    #    Example: "Hello," and "World!" will be converted to "Hello" and "World"
    #
    # 3) Convert all words into lowercases
    #    Example: "Hello" and "World" will be converted to "hello" and "world"
    #
    # Store the the number of times that a word appears in Alice in Wonderland
    # in the word_counts dictionary
